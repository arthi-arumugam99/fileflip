                    <h2>Common Support Questions</h2>
                    <p>Here are answers to our most frequent support inquiries:</p>

                    <div class="mini-faq">
                        <details>
                            <summary>FileFlip isn't converting my audio/video files</summary>
                            <p>Audio and video conversion requires FFmpeg, a free open-source multimedia framework. FileFlip will prompt you to install it when you first attempt an audio or video conversion. Follow the on-screen instructions, or download FFmpeg from <a href="https://ffmpeg.org/download.html" target="_blank" rel="noopener">ffmpeg.org</a> and ensure it's added to your system PATH. Image and document conversions work immediately without FFmpeg.</p>
                        </details>

                        <details>
                            <summary>Where are my converted files saved?</summary>
                            <p>By default, converted files are saved in the same folder as your original files, with the new file extension. You can change this behavior in Settings by specifying a custom output directory. Look for the "Output Directory" option in the Settings panel.</p>
                        </details>

                        <details>
                            <summary>Can I convert multiple files at once?</summary>
                            <p>Yes! FileFlip supports batch conversion. Simply drag and drop multiple files (or an entire folder) into the application, select your desired output format, and click Convert. There are no limits on the number of files you can convert at once.</p>
                        </details>

                        <details>
                            <summary>How do I request a refund?</summary>
                            <p>Refunds are handled by the app store where you purchased FileFlip. Please contact Microsoft Store, Mac App Store, or Snap Store support directly for refund requests. Each store has its own refund policy and timeframe.</p>
                        </details>

                        <details>
                            <summary>Does FileFlip work offline?</summary>
                            <p>Yes! FileFlip is designed to work 100% offline. After installation, no internet connection is required for any file conversion. Your files are processed locally and never leave your computer.</p>
                        </details>

                        <details>
                            <summary>How do I update FileFlip?</summary>
                            <p>Updates are delivered through your app store. Enable automatic updates in your Microsoft Store, Mac App Store, or Snap Store settings, or manually check for updates periodically. All updates are free and included with your purchase.</p>
                        </details>

                        <details>
                            <summary>The conversion failed or produced a corrupted file</summary>
                            <p>If a conversion fails: (1) Ensure the source file isn't corrupted by opening it in another application. (2) Check that you have sufficient disk space. (3) For audio/video files, verify FFmpeg is properly installed. (4) Try converting to a different format to isolate the issue. If problems persist, email us with the file type, conversion attempted, and any error messages.</p>
                        </details>

                        <details>
                            <summary>Can I convert password-protected PDFs?</summary>
                            <p>FileFlip can convert PDFs that are password-protected for printing/copying restrictions. However, PDFs that require a password to open cannot be converted without first removing the password using the original password and appropriate software.</p>
                        </details>

                        <details>
                            <summary>What image quality settings are available?</summary>
                            <p>FileFlip preserves original quality by default. For formats that support quality settings (like JPEG), you can adjust compression in the conversion options. Higher quality means larger file sizes, while lower quality reduces file size.</p>
                        </details>

                        <details>
                            <summary>Is FileFlip available for mobile devices?</summary>
                            <p>Currently, FileFlip is only available for desktop platforms (Windows, macOS, and Linux). We focus on desktop to provide the best offline conversion experience with full access to your file system.</p>
