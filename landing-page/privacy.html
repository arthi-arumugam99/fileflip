                    <p>FileFlip processes all files locally on your device:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Files you select for conversion remain on your computer at all times.</li>

                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>3. Information Collected by App Stores</h2>
                    <p>When you purchase or download FileFlip through an app store (Microsoft Store, Mac App Store, or Snap Store), those platforms may collect information according to their own privacy policies. This may include:</p>
                    <ul>

                        <li>Device information for licensing purposes</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>Important:</strong> FileFlip does not receive, access, or store any personal information from these transactions. We only receive confirmation that a valid license exists. Please review the privacy policies of the respective app stores for more information:</p>
                    <ul>

                <section>
                    <h2>5. Third-Party Services</h2>
                    <p>FileFlip does not integrate with or transmit data to any third-party services, advertising networks, or data brokers. The Software:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Does not contain advertisements</li>

                <section>
                    <h2>6. Data Security</h2>
                    <p>Because FileFlip does not collect or store your data on external servers, your information security depends on your own device security measures. We recommend:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Keeping your operating system and software up to date</li>
                        <li>Using strong passwords and encryption on your device</li>
                        <li>Following your organization's security policies if applicable</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>FileFlip is designed with privacy as a core principle - we cannot lose, breach, or misuse data we never collect.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>7. Children's Privacy (COPPA Compliance)</h2>
                    <p>FileFlip does not collect personal information from anyone, including children under 13 years of age. Because we do not collect any data:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>We do not knowingly collect information from children</li>
                        <li>There is no data to delete or manage</li>
                        <li>The Software is safe for users of all ages</li>
                        <li>Parental consent is not required as no data collection occurs</li>
                    </ul>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>8. International Users and Data Transfers</h2>
                    <p>FileFlip is available worldwide. Because all processing occurs locally on your device and we do not collect or transfer any personal data:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>There are no international data transfers</li>
                        <li>Your data remains in your jurisdiction at all times</li>

                    <p>FileFlip does not track users in any way, so there is no tracking to disable. We honor Do Not Track signals by default through our zero-collection design.</p>
                </section>

                <section>
                    <h2>11. Changes to This Privacy Policy</h2>

                    <h2>Our Privacy Commitment</h2>
                    <p>We built FileFlip because we believe file conversion should be private. In a world where most software harvests your data, we chose a different path. Your files are your business. We don't want your data, we don't need your data, and we've architected our software so we technically cannot access your data. That's privacy by design, not privacy by policy.</p>
